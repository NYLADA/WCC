		<h2> About Me :) </h2>
	<div class="body1">
		<p> Hello! My name is Adalyn Behan. I enjoy learning about computers and how they work. I enjoy playing games and learning about music.
		I have been singing for many years and in the most recent years I have been trying to learn how to play:
			<ul>
				<li>piano</li> 
				<li>bass guitar</li> 
				<li>ukulele</li> 
				<li>violin</li> 
				<li>ocarina</li>
				<li>kalimba</li>
				<li>alto saxophone</li>
			</ul>
		<p>I'm not really proficient at any of these yet aside from piano. I am also taking an AP music theory course at my high school to further my musical education even though it is not what I am pursuing.
		I get pretty busy with my school and extracurriculars so I don't get to practice as often as I would like but they are still fun to learn.</p>

		<p> Below is a link to a YouTube video of a song that I covered vocally and on piano. I also filmed it with the help of a friend! 
		It is my first film project and recording project so it was more just for fun than anything else.</p>
